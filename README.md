# Fake News Detection Model

This project was created using python and a tensorflow model that I trained on a publicly available data set of true and false news articles.  It's hosted for free on an open source platform called [Binder](https://notebooks.gesis.org/binder/) that just allows users to publicly host their jupyter notebook projects as interactive notebooks online.  Please feel free to play around and try it out at the link below!
